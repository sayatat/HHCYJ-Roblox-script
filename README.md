# HHCYJ-Roblox-script
A lil script for the game "How High Can You Jump?"
The script includes features such as:
* Auto Jump
* Auto Drink (Keep your drink equiped as it does not work without it!)
  
Soon to be added
* Auto Rebirth

This script is pretty basic with a bad ui. The Close button seems to clip into the title for whatever reason.
